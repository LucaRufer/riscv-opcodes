riscv-opcodes
===========================================================================

This repo enumerates standard RISC-V instruction opcodes, control and status
registers and PULP specific instruction opcodes. It also contains a script to
convert them into several formats (C, Python, Go, Scala, SystemVerilog LaTeX).
Functions will be instantiated to decode those instructions.
